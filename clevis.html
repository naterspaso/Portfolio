  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <div class="content-section description">
    <p>One of my first FSAE projects was redesigning a clevis for the suspension system. The clevis is what connects the suspension arms to the upright.</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li><strong>Problem:</strong> The previous clevis design was very hard to work on because there was no room to get a wrench onto the head of a bolt. So to take it off, one would need to jam a flathead screwdriver between the bolt and the clevis wall in order to prevent the bolt from spinning when the nut on the otherside was being turned.
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong>  I made a design which had walls which sat flush with the opposing flat sides of the hex bolt. This would effective act like a wrench preventing the bolt from spinning. However, it is still easy to remove and replace the bolt if necessary.</li>
