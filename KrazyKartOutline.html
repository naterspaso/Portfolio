    <h1>DIY KrazyKart</h1>
    <p>by Nathan Su</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <div class="content-section description">
    <p>I took inspiration from TaxiGarage, a company who professionally makes and sells KrazyKarts. There are many videos on the internet of people drifting their karts around town, going sideways around corners and having a great time. However, these karts are expensive, with the cheapest full sized (non-kids) kart starting at $900. Taking a closer look at their design, I saw how simple it was, and I thought it would be a fun project to make my own from scratch. In this project, I flux-core welded, learned about motor controllers, programmed an Arduino, designed the kart in CAD, and transformed my CAD model into real life.</p>

  <!-- Project Details -->
  <div class="content-section">
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong> I initially was planning to make it mostly out of wood due to the lower cost. However, I found a cheap welder on Craigslist so I decided that this would be a great opportunity to learn how to weld. </li>
      <li><strong>CAD Design</strong> I made a CAD assembly for the kart. I designed it to be easy to manufacture and used designs similar to those of cars and bicycles make the kart perform how I wanted.</li>
      <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> I bought materials for manufacturing using the bill of materials (BOM) I made for the kart based off my model. After buying the welder and necessary tools, I begain cutting, notching, and welding tubes, using the engineering drawings I made in CAD.</li>
      <li><strong>Motor Control:</strong> I used a 350W hub motor from a rental scooter as the front wheel to power the kart. I hooked it up to a generic 36v motor controller from Amazon. It was a little tricky to match the correct hall and phase wires, but eventually I got everything running. However, the throttle pedal I had gave a analog 0.8v-5v signal while the controller wanted a 0v-5v PWM signal. To solve this issue I used an Arduino to convert the analog signal to a digital one.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Future Improvements -->
  <div class="content-section">
    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li><strong>Stability:</strong> The kart would start to violently wobble at higher speed when a bump was hit. To reduce this, I would angle the fork away from the driver to induce a self-centering force on the wheel due to the mechanical trail.</li>
      <li><strong>Metal Floor:</strong> Due to a lack of time, I had to resort to using a thin, rain soaked piece of plywood as the floor. This was not sturdy whatsoever and made fastening electronics like the throttle, controller, and battery not secure. Ideally, I would use a piece of thin sheet metal as the floor.</li>
      <li><strong>Fastening Electronics:</strong> Also due to a lack of time, I did not have securely fastened electronics. I had only had time to 3d print a box for the Arduino. The other components like the battery and controller were ziptied and taped to the wooden floor. I would have liked to design a 3d printed box that could hold all of the electronics securely. This box would have holes for ventilation and bolt holes to be secured to the metal floor.</li>
    </ul>
